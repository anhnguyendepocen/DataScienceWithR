```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(arsenal)
```

#### Description

Summarize the freqlist object.

#### Usage
<pre><code>

## S3 method for class 'freqlist'
summary(object, ..., labelTranslations = NULL,
title = NULL)
## S3 method for class 'summary.freqlist'
as.data.frame(x, ..., list.ok = FALSE)

</code></pre>
#### Arguments

* ``object``: an object of class ``freqlist``
* ``...``: For summary.freqlist, these are passed to ``as.data.frame.freqlist`` (and hence to ``freq.control``). For the print method, these are additional arguments passed to the kable function.
* ``labelTranslations``: A named list (or vector) where the name is the label in the output to be replaced in the pretty rendering by the character string value for the named element of the list, e.g., ``list(age = "Age(Years)", meansd = "Mean(SD)")``.
* ``title``: Title for the table, defaulting to NULL (no title)
* ``x``: An object of class summary.freqlist.
* ``list.ok``: If the object has multiple by-variables, is it okay to return a list of data.frames instead of a single data.frame? If FALSE but there are multiple by-variables, a warning is issued.



#### Examples
```{r}
# load mockstudy data
data(mockstudy)
tab.ex <- table(mockstudy[c("arm", "sex", "mdquality.s")], useNA = "ifany")
noby <- freqlist(tab.ex, na.options = "include")
summary(noby)
withby <- freqlist(tab.ex, strata = c("arm","sex"), na.options = "showexclude")
summary(withby)
summary(withby, dupLabels = TRUE)
```
#### Value

An object of class "summary.freqlist" (invisibly for the print method).

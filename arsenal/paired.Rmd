Summary Statistics of a Set of Independent Variables Paired Across Two Timepoints

#### Description

Summarize one or more variables (x) by a paired time variable (y). Variables on the right side of the formula, i.e. independent variables, are summarized by the two time points on the left of the formula. Optionally, an appropriate test is performed to test the distribution of the independent variables across the time points.

#### Usage
<pre><code>

paired(formula, data, id, na.action, subset = NULL, strata,
control = NULL, ...)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments

* ``formula ``: an object of class formula of the form ``time ~ var1 + ....`` See "Details" for more information.
* ``data``:  an optional data frame, list or environment (or object coercible by as.data.frame to a data frame) containing the variables in the model. If not found in data, the variables are taken from environment(formula), typically the environment from which the function is called.
* ``id``: The vector giving IDs to match up data for the same subject across two time-points.
* ``na.action``:  a function which indicates what should happen when the data contain NAs. The default is ``na.paired("in.both")``. See ``na.paired`` for more details
* ``subset``: an optional vector specifying a subset of observations (rows of data) to be used in the results. Works as vector of logicals or an index.
* ``strata``:  a vector of strata to separate summaries by an additional group.
* ``control``:  control parameters to handle optional settings within paired. Two aspects of paired are controlled with these: test options of RHS variables and x variable summaries. Arguments for ``paired.control`` can be passed to paired via the ... argument, but if a control object and ... arguments are both supplied, the latter are used. See ``paired.control`` for more details.
* ``... ``: additional arguments to be passed to internal paired functions or paired.control.

#### Value

An object with class ``c("paired", "tableby", "arsenal_table")``


#### Details
Do note that this function piggybacks off of tableby quite heavily, so there is no summary.paired
function (for instance).

#### Tests
These tests are accepted:
• paired.t: a paired t-test.
• mcnemar: McNemar’s test.
• signed.rank: a signed rank test.
• sign.test: a sign test.
• notest: no test is performed.

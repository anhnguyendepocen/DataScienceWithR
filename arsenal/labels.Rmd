Labels

#### Description

Assign and extract the 'label' attribute on an R object. set_labels is the same as labels(x) <- value but returns x for use in a pipe chain. set_attr is the same as attr(x, which) <- value but re-
turns x for use in a pipe chain.

#### Usage
<pre><code>

## S3 method for class 'data.frame'
labels(object, ...)
## S3 method for class 'keep_labels'
labels(object, ...)
labels(x) <- valuemdy.Date

## S3 replacement method for class 'keep_labels'
labels(x) <- value
## Default S3 replacement method:
labels(x) <- value
## S3 replacement method for class 'data.frame'
labels(x) <- value
set_labels(x, value)
set_attr(x, which, value)

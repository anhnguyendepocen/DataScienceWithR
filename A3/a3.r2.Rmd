a3.r2 Cross-Validated R^2
#### Description
Applies cross validation to obtain the cross-validated R2 for a model: the fraction of the squared
error explained by the model compared to the null model (which is defined as the average response).
A pseudo R2 is implemented for classification.

#### Usage 
<pre><code>
a3.r2(y, x, simulate.fn, cv.folds)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments 

y a vector or responses.
x a matrix of features.
simulate.fn a function object that creates a model and predicts y.
cv.folds the cross-validation folds.

#### Value
A list comprising of the following elements:
* R2 the cross-validated R2
* predicted the predicted responses
* observed the observed responses

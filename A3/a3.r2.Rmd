## Cross-Validated $R^2$

#### Description
Applies cross validation to obtain the cross-validated $R^2$ for a model: the fraction of the squared error explained by the model compared to the null model (which is defined as the average response).
A pseudo $R^2$ is implemented for classification.

#### Usage 
<pre><code>
a3.r2(y, x, simulate.fn, cv.folds)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments 

* ``y``: a vector or responses.
* ``x``: a matrix of features.
* ``simulate.fn``: a function object that creates a model and predicts y.
* ``cv.folds``: the cross-validation folds.

#### Value
A list comprising of the following elements:

* ``R2``: the cross-validated R2
* ``predicted``: the predicted responses
* ``observed``: the observed responses

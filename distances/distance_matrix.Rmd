#### Description
``distance_matrix`` makes distance matrices (complete and partial) from distances objects.

#### Usage
<pre><code>
distance_matrix(distances, indices = NULL)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments
* ``distances``: A distances object.
* ``indices``: If NULL, the complete distance matrix is made. If integer vector with point indices, a partial matrix including only the indicated data points is made.

#### Value
Returns a distance matrix of class dist.
Check distances object

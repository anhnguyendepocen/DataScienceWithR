aggregate.cv Aggregate cross-validation results

#### Description 

Compute summary statistics of results from repeated K-fold cross-validation.

#### Usage 
<pre><code>
## S3 method for class 'cv'
aggregate(x, FUN = mean, select = NULL,...)
## S3 method for class 'cvSelect'
aggregate(x, FUN = mean,select = NULL, ...)
## S3 method for class 'cvTuning'
aggregate(x, ...)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments 

* x an object inheriting from class "cv" or "cvSelect" that contains cross-validation results (note that the latter includes objects of class "cvTuning").
* FUN a function to compute the summary statistics.
* select a character, integer or logical vector indicating the columns of cross-validation results for which to compute the summary statistics.
* ... for the "cvTuning" method, additional arguments to be passed to the "cvSelect"
method. Otherwise additional arguments 
 to be passed to FUN.



#### Examples 
```{r}

library("robustbase")
data("coleman")
set.seed(1234) # set seed for reproducibility
## set up folds for cross-validation
folds <- cvFolds(nrow(coleman), K = 5, R = 10)
## compare raw and reweighted LTS estimators for
## 50% and 75% subsets
# 50% subsets
fitLts50 <- ltsReg(Y ~ ., data = coleman, alpha = 0.5)
cvFitLts50 <- cvLts(fitLts50, cost = rtmspe, folds = folds,
fit = "both", trim = 0.1)
```
```{r}
# 75% subsets
fitLts75 <- ltsReg(Y ~ ., data = coleman, alpha = 0.75)
cvFitLts75 <- cvLts(fitLts75, cost = rtmspe, folds = folds, fit = "both", trim = 0.1)
# combine results into one object
cvFitsLts <- cvSelect("0.5" = cvFitLts50, "0.75" = cvFitLts75)
cvFitsLts
```
```{r}
# summary of the results with the 50% subsets
aggregate(cvFitLts50, summary)
# summary of the combined results
aggregate(cvFitsLts, summary)
## evaluate MM regression models tuned for
## 80%, 85%, 90% and 95% efficiency
tuning <- list(tuning.psi=c(3.14, 3.44, 3.88, 4.68))
```
```{r}
# set up function call
call <- call("lmrob", formula = Y ~ .)
# perform cross-validation
cvFitsLmrob <- cvTuning(call, data = coleman, y = coleman$Y, tuning = tuning, cost = rtmspe,
folds = folds, costArgs = list(trim = 0.1))
cvFitsLmrob
# summary of results
aggregate(cvFitsLmrob, summary)


```

#### Value
The "cv" method returns a vector or matrix of aggregated cross-validation results, depending on whether FUN returns a single value or a vector.
For the other methods, a data frame containing the aggregated cross-validation results for each model is returned. In the case of the "cvTuning" method, the data frame contains the combinations of tuning parameters rather than a column describing the models.

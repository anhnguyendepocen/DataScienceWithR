cvFit Cross-validation for model evaluation

#### Description 

Estimate the prediction error of a model via (repeated) K-fold cross-validation. It is thereby possible
to supply an object returned by a model fitting function, a model fitting function itself, or an
unevaluated function call to a model fitting function.

#### Usage 
<pre><code>

cvFit(object, ...)
## Default S3 method:
cvFit(object, data = NULL, x = NULL,
y, cost = rmspe, K = 5, R = 1,
foldType = c("random", "consecutive", "interleaved"),
folds = NULL, names = NULL, predictArgs = list(),
costArgs = list(), envir = parent.frame(), seed = NULL, ...)
## S3 method for class 'function'
cvFit(object, formula, data = NULL,
x = NULL, y, args = list(), cost = rmspe, K = 5, R = 1,
foldType = c("random", "consecutive", "interleaved"),
folds = NULL, names = NULL, predictArgs = list(),
costArgs = list(), envir = parent.frame(), seed = NULL,
...)
## S3 method for class 'call'
cvFit(object, data = NULL, x = NULL, y,
cost = rmspe, K = 5, R = 1,
foldType = c("random", "consecutive", "interleaved"),
folds = NULL, names = NULL, predictArgs = list(),
costArgs = list(), envir = parent.frame(), seed = NULL,
...)

</code></pre>

#### Arguments 

object the fitted model for which to estimate the prediction error, a function for fitting
a model, or an unevaluated function call for fitting a model (see call for the
latter). In the case of a fitted model, the object is required to contain a component
call that stores the function call used to fit the model, which is typically the case
for objects returned by model fitting functions.
formula a formula describing the model.
data a data frame containing the variables required for fitting the models. This is
typically used if the model in the function call is described by a formula.
12 cvFit
x a numeric matrix containing the predictor variables. This is typically used if the
function call for fitting the models requires the predictor matrix and the response
to be supplied as separate arguments 
.
y a numeric vector or matrix containing the response.
args a list of additional arguments 
 to be passed to the model fitting function.
cost a cost function measuring prediction loss. It should expect the observed values
of the response to be passed as the first argument and the predicted values as the
second argument, and must return either a non-negative scalar value, or a list
with the first component containing the prediction error and the second component
containing the standard error. The default is to use the root mean squared
prediction error (see cost).
K an integer giving the number of groups into which the data should be split (the
default is five). Keep in mind that this should be chosen such that all groups
are of approximately equal size. Setting K equal to n yields leave-one-out crossvalidation.
R an integer giving the number of replications for repeatedK-fold cross-validation.
This is ignored for for leave-one-out cross-validation and other non-random
splits of the data.
foldType a character string specifying the type of folds to be generated. Possible values
are "random" (the default), "consecutive" or "interleaved".
folds an object of class "cvFolds" giving the folds of the data for cross-validation (as
returned by cvFolds). If supplied, this is preferred over K and R.
names an optional character vector giving names for the arguments 
 containing the data
to be used in the function call (see "
details 
").
predictArgs a list of additional arguments 
 to be passed to the predict method of the fitted
models.
costArgs a list of additional 
arguments 
 to be passed to the prediction loss function cost.
envir the environment in which to evaluate the function call for fitting the models
(see eval).
seed optional initial seed for the random number generator (see .Random.seed).
... additional 
arguments 
 to be passed down.

#### Details 

(Repeated) K-fold cross-validation is performed in the following way. The data are first split into
K previously obtained blocks of approximately equal size. Each of the K data blocks is left out
once to fit the model, and predictions are computed for the observations in the left-out block with
the predict method of the fitted model. Thus a prediction is obtained for each observation.
The response variable and the obtained predictions for all observations are then passed to the prediction
loss function cost to estimate the prediction error. For repeated cross-validation, this process
is replicated and the estimated prediction errors from all replications as well as their average are
included in the returned object.
Furthermore, if the response is a vector but the predict method of the fitted models returns a
matrix, the prediction error is computed for each column. A typical use case for this behavior would
cvFit 13
be if the predict method returns predictions from an initial model fit and stepwise improvements
thereof.
If formula or data are supplied, all variables required for fitting the models are added as one argument
to the function call, which is the typical behavior of model fitting functions with a formula
interface. In this case, the accepted values for names depend on the method. For the function
method, a character vector of length two should supplied, with the first element specifying the argument
name for the formula and the second element specifying the argument name for the data (the
default is to use c("formula", "data")). Note that names for both 
arguments 
 should be supplied
even if only one is actually used. For the other methods, which do not have a formula argument, a
character string specifying the argument name for the data should be supplied (the default is to use
"data").
If x is supplied, on the other hand, the predictor matrix and the response are added as separate
arguments 
 to the function call. In this case, names should be a character vector of length two, with
the first element specifying the argument name for the predictor matrix and the second element
specifying the argument name for the response (the default is to use c("x", "y")). It should be
noted that the formula or data 
arguments 
 take precedence over x.

#### Value
An object of class "cv" with the following components:
n an integer giving the number of observations.
K an integer giving the number of folds.
R an integer giving the number of replications.
cv a numeric vector containing the respective estimated prediction errors. For repeated
cross-validation, those are average values over all replications.
se a numeric vector containing the respective estimated standard errors of the prediction
loss.
reps a numeric matrix in which each column contains the respective estimated prediction
errors from all replications. This is only returned for repeated crossvalidation.
seed the seed of the random number generator before cross-validation was performed.
call the matched function call.

## via model fitting function
# perform cross-validation
# note that the response is extracted from 'data' in

K = 5, R = 10, costArgs = list(trim = 0.1), seed = 1234)
## via function call

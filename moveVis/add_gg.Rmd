add_gg Add ggplot2 function to frames
#### Description
This function adds ggplot2 functions (e.g. to add layers, change scales etc.) to the animation
frames created with frames_spatial.
Usage
add_gg(frames, gg, data = NULL, ..., verbose = T)
#### Arguments 
frames list of ggplot2 objects, crated with frames_spatial.
gg ggplot2 expressions (see details), either as
6 add_gg
* an expression of one or a list of ggplot2 functions to be added to every
frame,
* a list of such of the same length as frames to add different ggplot2 expressions
per frame
data optional data used by gg (see details), either
* an object of any class, e.g. a data.frame, used by gg that will be added to
all frames,
* a list, e.g. of multiple data.frames, with length of frames to add different
data to each frame.
... additional (non-iterated) objects that should be visible to gg.
verbose logical, if TRUE, messages on the functionâ€™s progress are displayed (default).
Details
Agrument gg expects ggplot2 functions handed over as expressions (see expr) to avoid their evaluation
before thex are called for the correct frame. Simply wrap your ggplot2 function into expr()
and supply it to gg. To add multiple ggplot2 functions to be applied on every frame, supply an expression
containing a list of ggplot2 functions (e.g. expr(list(geom_label(...), geom_text(...)))).
This expression would be added to all frames. To add specific ggplot2 functions per frame, supply
a list of expressions of the same length as frames. Each expression may contain a list of ggplot2
functions, if you want to add multiple functions per frame.
If data is used, the ggplot2 expressions supplied with gg can use the object by the name data
for plotting. If data is a list, it must be of the same length as frames. The list will be iterated,
so that functions in gg will have access to the individual objects within the list by the name data
per each frame. If the data you want to display is does not change with frames and may only be a
character vector or similiar, you may not need data, as you can supply the needed values within the
expression supplied through gg.
If you supply gg as a list of expressions for each frame and data as a list of objects (e.g. data.frames)
for each frame, each frame will be manipulated with the corresponding ggplot2 function and the
corresponding data.
Value
List of frames.
